This repository is a host for my Blood Soup/MaferGames translations.

To download, simply click on the green "Code" dropdown button, click "Download ZIP", and extract the files to a safe place on your computer.
To extract the games themselves, double click on the ".001" ZIP files inside and let them run. Please make sure they're extracted to the folders they're in. (they're in parts because of GitHub's 100mb file size limit)

If there are any problems or bugs I've missed, feel free to leave an issue report in the "Issues" tab and I'll do my best to fix it.

Please support Mafer using the link below!
